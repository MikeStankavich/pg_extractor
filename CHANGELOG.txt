2.0.8
* Fixed regression from 2.0.7 that caused all default privileges (if set) to be skipped when --getall or --getdefaultprivs was set

2.0.7
* Fixed error being thrown when using regex filters when any default privileges had been altered.

2.0.6
* Added support for materialized views. They will be output along with views. Thanks to zgkrepo on Github for the new feature!

2.0.5
* The --host option no longer defaults to "socket.gethostname()". This was forcing pg_dumpall to connect locally via TCP instead of just using the default local socket. This was causing issues for some pg_hba.conf configurations. If a TCP connection is desired, please set the --host option or use the PGHOST env variable. (also removed import of socket library since it's no longer needed).

2.0.4
* Fixed SHARING_VIOLATION error when running on Windows. (Github Issue #29)

2.0.3
* Fixed error being thrown when giving multiple schemas to the -n, -N, -nf, or -Nf filters. (Github Issue #27)
* Allow comments in filter files. Start the line with #. (Github Issue #27)

2.0.2
* Fixed errors being thrown when --jobs option was used to extract schemas, rules, triggers, sequences, or types (Github Issue #26)
* Fixed incorrect contents being output into extracted files when --jobs option was being used. If you were using --jobs option before, please re-run script again to fix any incorrect file contents. (Discovered when fixing Github Issue #26)

2.0.1
* Remove python 3 check at the top of the script. This allows the 3to2 conversion script to make a working version of pg_extractor for python 2.7 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2) (Github Issue #24)
* Fixed broken option --schema_include, --schema_include_file, --schema_exclude, --schema_exlude_file. (Github Issue #25)
